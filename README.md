# Project one: Tiger King Minesweeper

![Tiger King](/assets/joe-exotic.jpg)

## Overview

Minesweeper is a classic game where the player aims to clear a board containing hidden "mines"  without detonating any of them. The location of the mines can be determined through numbered clues displayed in adjacent tiles.

In this Tiger King version of Minesweeper, the mines are replaced by Joe Exotic and the flags are displayed as paw prints.

This was my first project from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course. It was an individual project which was built over the course of a week.
